# Security Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the security policies and best practices for the **End-to-End Data Architecture for Leather Shoe Company** project. The project contains sensitive data processing components, and security is a primary concern to ensure data integrity, privacy, and system protection.

**Note:** This repository contains only the **key structural components** of the project. Most **confidential code and sensitive information** have been removed, and in its current state, the application **will not function**.

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them responsibly by following these guidelines:

- Contact the project maintainer directly via a private communication channel (email or direct message on GitHub).
- Do **not** disclose the issue publicly until an appropriate fix has been implemented.
- Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it.
- Allow a reasonable timeframe for resolution before publicly discussing the vulnerability.

## Security Best Practices
### 1. Authentication & Access Control
- All sensitive endpoints require **authentication and authorization**.
- Passwords are **hashed** before being stored in the database (e.g., using `werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash`).
- **Flask-Login** is implemented for managing user sessions securely.

### 2. Database Security
- **AWS RDS & Redshift** credentials are stored in environment variables and never hardcoded.
- Proper database permissions and roles are set to restrict data access.
- **Parameterization** is used in SQL queries to prevent **SQL Injection** attacks.

### 3. API Security
- OpenAI API keys are stored securely in environment variables.
- Rate-limiting and authentication mechanisms are in place to prevent unauthorized access.
- CORS policies are configured to restrict access to trusted domains.

### 4. Data Protection & Encryption
- All **user data, logs, and financial records** are encrypted before storage.
- Secure communication is enforced using **HTTPS/TLS**.
- Logs containing sensitive information are **sanitized** before storage.

### 5. Secure Logging & Monitoring
- **Daily logs** are stored and uploaded to RDS for tracking and debugging.
- Suspicious activities and authentication failures are logged for security auditing.
- Alerts and notifications are set up for security incidents.

### 6. Secure Deployment & Environment Configuration
- The project uses **.env files** to manage secrets and credentials securely.
- Docker containers and AWS EC2 instances follow **least privilege principles**.
- Regular **security updates and patches** are applied to all dependencies.

## Dependencies & Updates
- Dependencies are kept up to date using `pip list --outdated` and automated dependency checks.
- Vulnerability scans are performed regularly using security tools like `bandit` or `safety`.

## Responsible Disclosure
We follow industry best practices for responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If a fix is required, we will release an update and notify affected users promptly.

For any security-related concerns, please reach out to the project maintainers directly.
